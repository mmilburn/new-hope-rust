# About the Project

This project is an unfinished Rust implementation of the
[NewHope](https://www.newhopecrypto.org/) post-quantum key-exchange protocol.
The goals of the project were to:

- Learn more about Rust
- Learn about post-quantum cryptography methods and the
[Ring-LWE problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_learning_with_errors)

# Why is it Unfinished?

I felt that having tests in place (I still believe this) as I developed
components was the only way to ensure I could make forward progress. At the
time I struggled with developing effective tests for unfamiliar concepts (e.g.
Number Theoretic Transforms, Montgomery Multiplication, Keccak). At a certain
point, I got stuck. While I now feel better I have a much better chance of
finishing this implementation, I have yet to return to it.
